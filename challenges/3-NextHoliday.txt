Task:

Create a webserver that responds to all requests by informing the user of the next US holiday

Tips:

- Google has a public calender that shows the holidays, as well as a nice API the delivers the data in JSON format. The URL that will return the list of holidays till the end of the year is 'http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/en.usa%23holiday%40group.v.calendar.google.com/public/basic?alt=jsonc&start-min=2011-08-24T00:00:00&start-max=2011-12-31T23:59:59&orderby=starttime&sortorder=a'
- Node makes creating clients easy. Check out http.get() (or for more options, http.request()) method in the node.js docs

Extra Credit:

- Tell the user how long until the holiday
- Optionally respond with a json object
