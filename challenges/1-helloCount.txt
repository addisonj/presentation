Task:

Write a web server that responds to all requests with a simple "Hello World" message. Also, keep a server-side count of how many requests have been made and include this count in the response to the user.

Tips:

- Look at the Hello World example on nodejs.org
- Anything not in the connection handler function is basically a global variable

Extra Credit

- Write to console whenever anyone connects
- Keep track of how long the server is up
