Task:

Write a TCP chat server.

Tips:

- Don't cheat! This is a pretty common thing and their are lots of examples on the web. Instead, read the node.js docs for the "net" module and figure it out yourself
- Use telnet or netcat to connect (most of you have probably never used either of these tools, but they boost your geek cred)
- Make sure to handle disconnects, or things will crash!

Extra Credit:

- Make announcements when users join or leave
- Implement a few server commands, such as '/list' to show all currently connected users
