The first role of the node.js new developer challenges is not to worry to much about the node.js new developer challenges. These aren't here to torment you, and finishing them won't make you any cooler. 

With that said, the thing I always find hardest in learning some new platform or language is finding something to do to help me learn it. I tend to read a lot of articles and talk to lots of people about this new thing, but I am slow to dive in and actually use it. 

These challenges are designed to curb that tendency that I (and many others) have and to just start coding. They start easy, but get difficult pretty quick. Learning something new doesn't happen in a day, so neither should these challenges, instead, the idea is to struggle a bit, to have a real problem to solve and to direct your learning more. 

The second rule of the node.js new developer challenges is to learn. If you complete all of these, I can't gurantee you will be an amazing node.js dev, but I an promise that you will have learned something. 

So, get cracking, but before you start, you must know rule three of the node.js new developer challenges, which is, there are no other rules. Tweak this, fork it, change it. As long as you are coding and learning you are making progress.

Best of luck
